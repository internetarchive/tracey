# Blogs & Websites from Markdown & JS
## Content first, Decentralizable, Archivable

### Tracey Jaquith DwebCamp 2022

---
## Publish full blog and web pages
- content 100% markdown
- theme and markdown-to-markup done with JavaScript
- free github.com, gitlab.com
  - using a `sitemap.xml` or RSS feed, pages can be hosted anywhere
    - including DWeb
    - like "pointers" to your posts/pages

---
## How
- JS "crawls" your site
  - parses markdown "front matter"
    - date
    - title
    - tags
    - categories
  - uses `showdown` to convert to HTML
  - re-paints page
  - uses `localStorage` to save analyzed site, auto-updates daily (_can force re-cache_)
  - uses `lunr` for browser searching your posts/pages

---
## Why
- save each post or page as single markdown file
  - markdown is primary, archive-friendly, format/theme agnostic
  - site formatting is _secondary_
- all posts and pages can live in free `git` repo on github.com, gitlab.com, DWeb, self-hosted, etc.
- no build step, no backend needed
  - just a static file server
- theme can be changed anytime (1 line change)
- good google SEO
  - google & more crawlers doing JS rendering

---
## Why
- "View Source" is your original content -- no formatting, no clutter

- You're in control of your content
- posting to facebook, twitter, strava sucks
  - where is your content?
  - _what_ do you do with your GDPR? (xxx)
- should last forever
- "roach proof" content-only format

---
## Static Sites
- comments possible using `staticman`, etc.
  - `staticman` -- comments go into your site repository
- website search using `lunr` JS
- can use `git` "hooks" to run small script:
  - keeps `sitemap.xml` and RSS feed up-to-date
  - minor comments management

---
## Try it!
Simple as:
- create new file
- index.html
  - contents:

# Preview
- use any basic http file server, eg:
```sh
python3 -m http.server
```
- OR open `index.html` in browser
  - [mac]: double click from `finder` folder; `open index.html` in `terminal`
- copy url to `safari` (if not already)
- dev tools, disable CORS restrictions xxx
- reload

- https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWhoVkYm2SNoPEAK5ZmKFNtqVAietNsdzZrZYWK9KaXw9/


---
# Publish
- make https://github.com account
- create and `git clone` a new repository
- add your `index.html` file
- add `.nojekyll` (empty) file
- `git push`
- turn on GitHub Pages xxx
- https://[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME].github.io/[REPOSITORY-NAME]/

---
# Extending out
- millions of sites linked together
- save a list of friends and families for a merged activity "feed"
- only needs to determine latest few posts from each site per sitemap/RSS
  - JS "crawl" them, parse their markdown, merge into decentralized feed
