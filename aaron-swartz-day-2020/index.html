Tracey will discuss the Internet Archive's ultra-modern javascript and docker/containerization.

Tracey is transitioning IA’s TV and A/V processing (back-end) to javascript and will show
new and interesting ways to setup modern JS with a “light touch” and get going really quickly.

On the container side, she setup a new way to allow people to do arbitrary archive item processing in any coding language repo, auto-building a docker image.

For examples, Merlijn is replacing IA’s OCR tools with a python3 based repo and toolset;
Tracey & Jake moved a new audio segment tagger (“is this part of the audio speech or is it music?”) to python3.
