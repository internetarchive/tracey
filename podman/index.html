## What's a Container?
![logo.png](logo.png)
- Standardization, abstraction
 - Think cargo container for software
- Single built file
  - "I want 10 copies of this container"

---
## What's a Container?
![logo.png](logo.png)
- Contains everything needed to run
- Lightweight, not a full virtual machine
- Unique identifier per container ( URI )
- Run anywhere
 - Development laptops
 - On demand
 - Server clusters

---
## How have containers Helped Us?
- We standardized on Docker
- Standardized testing and deployment
 - Automated tests are run in containers
 - Staging apps run in containers
- Management
 - Auditable, repeatable
 - Ability to roll complex changes back
 - Increased availability (relatively easily)

---
## Deriver Containers

- Creates item `mp3`, `pdf`s, etc.
- Provides isolation
  - Limited visibility ( _single_ item dir )
  - Unable to corrupt other tasks/files
- Ephemeral storage
  - Temporary files are removed automatically

---

## Current risks with Docker 😞

 * Not designed for security, designed for abstraction
 * Daemon is single point of failure
 * Elevated privileges
  - wide blast radius
  - ability to read and write other files
  - increased risk of breakout (eg shell escape)

![docker_vs_podman.jpeg](docker_vs_podman.jpeg)
- Currently using `docker`
- Looking seriously at `podman`
- Fewer moving parts
- Unix philosophy ( do one thing well )


---

![podman_logo.png](podman_logo.png)
- Open Source, permissive license
- Drop in replacement for `docker`
- Supported
  - Created & Maintained by RedHat
  - [Hundreds of contributors](https://github.com/containers/podman)
- Stable
 - v1.0 released in Jan 2019

---

![podman_logo.png](podman_logo.png)
- Can run as user with no privileges
- Can run containers anywhere
  - no `docker` daemon
  - no `iptables` / routing changes
- May help deriver container start/stop reliability

# Demo
"hello world" web page podman container

 * `rootless`
 * runs as `www-priv`
 * no file r/w access

# Current work
- TV "fixer" catalogd tasks
  - r/w _single_ item dir
  - running ~300/day

- epub "on the fly" `daisy` format
  - rootless container
  - (scheduled for release)

---
# The End 🎬
Thanks! 🙏

We'd love to talk to anyone interested afterwards

# Bonus / After time:
- [jammy+] `podman` apt/debian pkg
- [focal] opensuse.org distro => `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`

---
# apt packages
- _podman_
- _uidmap_: maps outside => inside userid/gid
- _slirp4netns_: rootless networking
- _fuse-overlayfs_: rootless file r/w
- _containernetworking-plugins_


---
# UID
podman "rootless" techniques:
- uid maps
- random user uid
  - hybrid of "rootfull" & "rootless"
  - better network & file r/w performance


---
# Rootless More Info
- [2023 rootless podman user namespaces in plain english](https://blog.podman.io/2023/05/rootless-podman-user-namespaces-in-plain-english/)
- [2023 podman performance root and rootless](https://blog.podman.io/2023/07/podman-performance-root-and-rootless/)

## rootless -v- rootfull
rootless slower than rootful:
- networking & storage – must be done in _user space_ instead of _kernel space_
  - _storage_:
    - older kernels: FUSE filesystem `fuse-overlayfs`
    - newer kernels (5.11+, jammy): kernel allows `podman` the `overlayfs` filesystem natively as non-root user
  - _networking_: `slirp4netns` manually reassembles & forwards packets to container
    - speedup by r/w volume mounts
    - OR `podman run --net=host`
      - but `opsec` 📉

---
## rootless -v- rootfull:
## random user id
-  `podman run --userns=auto` allows root `podman` to:
  - creates container w/ performance advantages of root
    - (kernel-native overlayfs & bridge networking)
  - runtime security advantages of rootless
    - container has no access to the host’s root user


---

## _deriver_ in 10 seconds

 * At a high level
  * Takes item content as input
  * Works with the content
  * Produces some output

 * Examples include
  * Text version of PDF
  * mp3 conversion
  * ...


---
## A container platform?
- Software that runs containers
- Handles administrative actions
 - `start/stop`, `view logs`, etc.
- Many different flavours
  - (`docker`, `podman`, `runc`, `lxc`, `...` )

---
## Going forward

 * Removing *all* elevated privileges
 * Simplifying architecture
 * Lowering latency on startup
