# How have Containers Helped Us?
  xxx

---
# A New Way
So now we are looking into lighterweight, more secure container runner

- no docker daemon

---
# Risks
- attack root process
- attack root user or *any* user (if all your data is r/w by the same user, breaking out means can)
- can run containers anywhere since no daemon, doesnt mess w/ `iptables` / routing
- rootless means non-root user
  - if you run as root, you can r/w all content & OS files w/ a breakout

---
# Help
- `podman` could help with deriver container start/stop reliability


---
# Security++
- Now with Rob K. on board, more focus on security
- considering `podman` for our `nomad` clusters


---
# Bonus / After time:
podman "rootless" techniques:
- uid maps
- rand user uid
  - hybrid of "rootfull" and "rootless"
  - better network & file r/w performance
