## Software

| | |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| ~2010 | sharing up to 3 minute clips |
| ~2015 | clip tagging (eg: subjects, political ad, misc.) |
| 2020 | create `.mp4` with 1 pass (was 2) (~2x faster) |
| 2020 | moved processing from PHP to Javascipt |
| 2021 | `GPU` - 100x faster .mp4 creation |
| 2021/2022 | reuse h.264 from broadcast<br> (all but 5 channels moved from MPEG2) |


---
## As we process faster
- show avail for researcher search **~45m** after show finishes
- can get that to **~10m** (h.264 reuse)
- can get to **1-2m** behind live (HLS)
