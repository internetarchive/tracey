  The restoration of Star Wars  began in 1995 and took the combined efforts of three companies, [20] under the payroll of Twentieth Century Fox: Pacific Titles, who handled optical printing, Lucasfilm, who organized the restoration and brought in ILM, and YCM Labs, who were responsible for color timing (arguably the most important of the three, since the faded colors were the biggest concern), as well as the supervision of film restoration consultant Leon Briggs and Fox's head of post-production Ted Gagliano. To start, Briggs had the negative cleaned, removing dirt and grime that had accumulated in its many years of use, by running it through a 104-degree sulfur bath solution and then hand-wiping it [21]. Star Wars' negative contained four separate types of film stocks [22] (Kodak 5243, an intermediate, probably for composites, 5247, a fine grain 100 EI tungsten stock that the live action must have been shot on, and 5253, an intermediate used as a separation stock that all visual effects elements were shot on [see note], plus the CRI stock [23]), however, and two of them could not be subjected to the solution and needed to be addressed on their own [24]. Each stock had to be washed separately anyway, unlike conventional restoration where the negative would have been washed in one piece and then wiped by hand [25], and so the negative was carefully disassembled."
  <p>
    That made everybody suck in their breath," recalls Tom Kennedy, effects producer on the release. "Thankfully, Robert Hart, the neg cutter on the second and third films, came in to put the negative back together." [26] When this process was over, much of the dirt that had plagued previous releases (which, when projected, is often mistaken for grain) was gone and a clear image was had.
  <p>
    It would have been far too cost prohibitive to scan and digitally restore the entire film at that time, so only the shots that were going to be enhanced with digital effects ended up in the computer. "After selectively cleansing the negative they'd remove and send us those piece sections of the original negative for which we were doing the special edition work," reports Tom Kennedy. [27] This was to the viewer's benefit--though perhaps better than optical compositing, scanning technology back then was only as advanced as 2K resolution, not much more than standard HD (which also means all the SE enhancements are at this res), so it was better that only portions ended up in this downgrade. "After doing various tests, we found out right away that nothing beats scanning original negative. Star Wars was an A-B neg cut, which meant that they could actually lift and slug original negative and send it back to ILM whenever we were enhancing a live-action shot. I think this is the first time someone has tried to bring a Seventies effects film back to the big screen." [28] For parts of the negative that were damaged, ILM preferred to use a scan from an IP instead, says Kennedy in ILM: Into the Digital Realm. [29]

  <p>
    While ILM worked on digital upgrades, the degrading CRI shots needed to be addressed. Because some were made from different composites on an optical printer, even in the best of conditions there would be heavy dupe grain and extra dirt that was printed on the image itself and couldn't be removed. One can see this in the scene where Luke activates the lightsaber in Ben's hovel--the moment the special effect enters the shot, the level of dirt and grain jumps noticeably (this was also shot on normal 35mm cameras, rather than the higher quality Vistavision, because the saber effects were originally to be in-camera). What was worse was that this didn't just plague special effects shots but shots with wipes or dissolves, and the generation loss was there whether they were printed on CRI or regular Kodak Eastman stock. The solution, then, was to go back to the original pieces and make new composites. For instance, in a scene with a wipe transition, the original two shots blended with the wipe were still in storage somewhere, with the O-neg piece being a second-generation duplicate of them combined together.
  <p>
    Ironically, just as ILM was retiring optical printers and moving into the digital realm, the technology was resurrected again. Pacific Titles had eleven state of the art, modern optical printers with new lenses, which, when combined with Kodak's finest film stock, gave "a boost in resolution and color saturation," according to company vice-president Phillip Feiner. [30] They re-composited all wipes and transitions (the "bread and butter" opticals, as Feiner calls them). These new negatives were then cut into the O-neg, replacing the originals (which, I must presume, were put in storage). One caveat of this is that each time the negative has a new portion of film cut into it, a frame on either side of it is lost in the process of cementing the new film piece into the reel; if one compares closely the SE to the previous releases, one finds that any new shot is missing a few frames at the head and tail, though the difference is imperceptible when in motion.
  <p>
    The visual effects shots were faced with the same problems as the conventional opticals: a deteriorated film stock (in CRI instances; in others, milder color fading), and dupe grain and dirt. The shots also contained matte lines, which were beginning to become a thing of the past as films began to utilize digital compositing. Footage from documentaries on the SE reveals that ILM had gone back to the original special effects elements, which had been meticulously saved, and then scanned and digitally recomposited them (in some instances, their placement is slightly different than the original, even though the principle was to match them as closely as possible--for instance, the seeker ball in the scene of Luke's Millennium Falcon training is positioned not quite the same as the original composite, though the difference is basically imperceptible while in motion). In American Cinematographer, it is never stated that this re-compositing process was enacted for every visual effect, but it seems that at the very least most of them were. [31] When these were finished, they were printed back onto film and cut into the O-neg, again replacing the originals. The O-neg was slowly being subsumed by new material.

  <p>But meanwhile, the rest of the film needed to be tackled. Most of the negative could be addressed by simply color-timing the image to get rid of the blue and pink shift that had occurred, but some parts were in more serious need of repair. What the policy was here is unclear--were the portions that were ripped and damaged, or normal live-action printed on CRI (i.e. if it had been flipped optically), replaced with new negatives culled from IPs? There have been unofficial sources that have suggested as much, and this was certainly the case with the ILM scans, but it's not always clear if the O-neg itself gained new physical pieces made from second-generation prints. ILM: Into the Digital Realm states that the IP was used to restore the negative, but later it is said that this was done on occassion by ILM for their work (i.e. re-compositing effects, adding CG). ILM: Into the Digital Realm does, however, imply that there was new negative pieces made from the original separation masters. Separation masters are black and white prints (on color film, that is) of each color spectrum of the negative--yellow, cyan and magenta. Each of these color fields are preserved on special metallic silver compositions, which never fade, and which, when re-combined, give a perfect re-construction of the original negative. Ted Gagliano states: "You know the original negative will fade, so you can turn to the separation masters; it's the record of what it'll look like and it'll last forever. So the negative you make off your YCMs should be just as good as the original negative." [32] The negative was being cannibalized by other pieces.
  </p>

  <p>Much of the "corrected" version of the O-neg was accomplished by the work of YCM Labs, who combated the color fading by re-timing the image to bring back its lustre. "Darth Vader isn't black anymore," says Pete Comandini, engineer at the company, "he starts out coming up to a navy blue and then getting brighter and brighter as the film continues to deteriorate." [33] To guide them in how the film should look, they used dye-transfer Technicolor prints. Technicolor was still making dye-transfer prints in the late 70s in the United Kingdom, though they would soon phase them out. Rather than using chemicals to make release prints, like Kodak or DeLuxe, which had bad contrast, poor color reproduction and heavy grain, but are inexpensive and easy to make, these prints were made of three strips of dyed film, which gave the prints a vibrant image with a very fine grain structure. More importantly, because they are not chemical but dye-based, they never fade. George Lucas loaned YCM Labs his very own personal Technicolor print, which still looked the same as it had when he put it in storage some twenty years earlier. "George had a private [Technicolor] print in the basement of his home," Gagliano notes. "For the color timing he told us to go for that look: 'That's the Star Wars I made,' he told us." [34]
  </p>

  <p>Since much of the restoration was color-timing accomplished by YCM Labs, this begs the conclusion--since the negs themselves can't be physically altered, the restoration's final product must have been a new IP with correct coloring. Whenever films are color-timed, it is the Interpositives from which theatrical prints work from--original negatives do not contain any color-timing information, so whenever a release goes back to the original negatives, all the color-timing is lost and the film must be re-timed from scratch all over again. It is doubtful that an entirely new negative was struck from the corrected IP for Star Wars, which might explain why Lucas enacted a second color-timing effort in 2004 when he returned to the original negatives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Had the film remained like this, we would have a restored version of Star Wars, perfectly matching the original release but with pristine quality, even to the point where it was better than what could have been possible back then (as with the higher quality optical transitions). However, this was only part of the process of making what was eventually called "The Special Edition." ILM was working on many dozens of new shots, and an even larger amount of enhanced shots, using digital effects to re-do, expand, re-edit and otherwise alter many scenes in the film. When these were completed, they apparently were printed onto film and re-cut into the negative, replacing the original negs, which were undoubtedly put back into storage. As a result, the negative for Star Wars is filled with CGI-laden modern alterations. When Lucas says that the original version physically does not exist, this is what he really means--the negative is conformed to the Special Edition. Of course, it would be very easy to simply put the original pieces back and conform it to the original version, or use the separation masters and IPs, or simply scan the old pieces for a digital restoration, but I digress.
  </p>

  <p>The Special Edition of Star Wars was frequently reported in the media as costing as much as $20 million to enhance and restore, though some sources claimed as low as $10 million. [35] In any case, the film's restoration and enhancement cost more than the original production itself--all of it being paid for by Twentieth Century Fox. At the time, spending upwards of $20 million on a decades-old film that, back then, was only to be a limited release, was a very big gamble. Many speculated that they did so in order to win Lucas' favor and get a chance at distributing the Star Wars prequels that went to camera a few months later. As the Special Edition drew greater and greater interest, it was decided to do a full-scale release, rather than a limited one. On January 31st, 1997, the Special Edition of Star Wars opened in theatres. The film became the biggest January opener in history, and earned $138 million, making the twenty-year-old film one of the top money makers of that year. It was released on VHS and Laserdisk in August--unfortunately, in the telecine the film received a pink tint, making the color referencing and restoration that YCM Labs did lost (you can tell this pink tint is from the telecine and not the negatives because it's on the CG shots as well). It was released again in 2000--this time removing the titling of "Special Edition." Because this was supposed to supplant the original, all prints in circulation of the original were recalled (studios control all rented prints--none are sold privately, though a black market exists), and possibly destroyed (studio print masters are, of course, kept). Today, Fox/Lucasfilm--Lucasfilm gained the rights in 1998 or 1999--only loans out prints of the Special Edition (no theatrical prints were ever made of the 2004 SE).
