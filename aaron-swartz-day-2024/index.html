## Don't Bury the Lead
## üèõÔ∏è Internet Archive **badly hacked** sep/oct 2024
- first time since our start (1996) where we took *all* servers off network
- month+ of "opsec" work

---
## Operational Security Intro
Keep systems & servers **secure**, reliable & performant

Applies to:
- server & VM management
- cloud management (self-hosted & 3rd party)
- database storage & access
- code deployment
- data handling

---
## Attack Surface Management
Exposed Areas
- PHP entry points
- public endpoints
- database access points
- shell commands
- JS cross site scripting

---
## Attack Surface Management mitigations
- disable unnecessary modules, old code
- lock down open ports
- limit public access to APIs
- prefer fewer ways in (centralize monitoring)

---
# Securing PHP
- strict coding standards & linting
- regular updates
- disable dangerous functions (`eval()`, `escape()` shell args, etc.)
- static analysis tools like `PHPStan` or `Psalm` to find vulnerabilities
- `htmlentities` user input/metadata into pages (XSS)

---
# Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
Welcome to example.com!

Enter your page title here:
```sh
&lt;script> document.write("page is mine") &lt;/script>
```

---
# General Security
## Principle of Least Privilege
- Role Based Access Control to clouds
- Limit DB access rights per service or user role
- Don't add secrets/tokens if you don't need them
- Run deploys as non-root
- Restrict network & DB access
- Prefer static file servers

---
# General Security
- SQL Injection: Use `prepared statements`, escape arguments, etc.
- Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data/secrets in transit & storage where possible

---
## Secure Command Line Calls
- avoid `root` users
- Defend against files named:
  - `movie.mp4; find / -delete`
- Sanitize inputs, use PHP `escapeshellarg()`
- prefer pre-defined scripts -v- dynamic shell commands

---
# Secrets Management
- Secure Storage: secrets management tools
  - HashiCorp `vault`, AWS Secrets Manager
- dont `git commit` secrets
  - dont deploy `.git` subdir
    - contains all prior "sins"
- Use environment variables or dedicated storage for credentials/keys
  - use orchestration (`kubernetes`, `nomad`) with automatic secrets managment
    - env var injection into **container** at **runtime**

---
## Authentication & Access Control
- Virtual Private Network (VPN)
  - lockown access to servers only to ops/devs
- 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) for logins
- `passkeys` - knock out spear/phishing

---
## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Control access based on **roles** (principle of least privilege)
- deploy phase can only **read** from container registry
- dev groups with limited deploy access
- avoid "god" tokens

---
# Network Security
- Firewall Rules: Enforce strict firewall rules for access to apps/deploys & DB servers
- `nginx` Web Application Firewall
- Zero Trust Architecture: Consider Zero Trust for internal/external network communications
- assume private code might leak
  - defensive coding
  - secrets elsewhere

---
# Logging & Monitoring
- Comprehensive Logging
  - Log all significant actions
    - login attempts, database access & command executions
- Alerts setup for suspicious activities & abnormal patterns
- Centralize logging, monitoring & alerting

---
# Clouds, CI/CD & Git Ops
- dev makes commit & push
- automatic Continuous Integration (CI)
  - re/build container from `Dockerfile`
  - re/test code & containers
- automatic Continuous Deployment (CD)
  - re/deploy to cloud when CI passes
  - automatic healthchecking
  - automatic rollback

---
## Automation in Security Operations
- CI/CD Integration: Embed security checks in CI/CD pipelines
  - static code analysis
  - secrets/token scanning
  - dependency scanning
- Automated Response: playbooks for incident response (disable accounts, block IPs in real-time)

---
## Backup & Disaster Recovery
- Regular Backups: Enforce frequent & tested backups for data integrity
  - use checksums for tampering detection
- Disaster Recovery Drills:
  - simulate recovery scenarios & test readiness
- DB & data backups
  - consider nonpublic data backup


---
# Avoid monoliths
- they **acrete** secrets, code, vulnerabilities & older pkgs/setups over time
- slower CI/CD
- hard for new people
- hard for comprehensive opsec analysis & defense

---
# Embrace Microservices
examples:
- deploys for login systems
- deploys for metatadata
  - APIs can be used internally & externally
- deploys for data processing
  - eg: dynamically resize book page imagery

---
# Embrace Microservices
- DB, network, or command line access can only be "opt-in" not the default
- minimal or zero secrets/tokens per deploy
- can be completely cutoff from data storage
- web servers can be 100% read-only

---
# Houses -v- Farms
- pets / "houses" fine to be self-managed VMs / baremetals
- scalable systems "farms" easily "rebooted", moved, replaced, scaled
  - automatic spin up/down 5 more deploys based on demand

---
## Stay up-to-date
- Must continually improve
  - regular audits & updates
  - stay up-to-date on emerging security threats
  - continual patching of OS, packages & deploys CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures)
- dump unsupported OS, software, languages (eg: `python2`)

---
## Conclusions
- Large complex systems increase opsec concerns & issues
- Embrace containers, clouds & orchestration
  - everything dev & ops do is already solved territory ‚òÄÔ∏è
- Microservices where makes sense
- Stay up on opsec, leverage industry best practices
